Hello Professor Gray! As you know I did not heed your warnings about waiting until the last minute to do this assingment. So I unfortunately worked as hard as I could on it the past three days, and ended up with something that I am not proud of whatsoever. 
With that being said. I was able to deploy whatever this is and hope you might be able to take a look at some of the code that I was able to complete.
I attempted to submit this in netify but since I did not get to work on many of the Requests it would not give me a score to submit.
I struggled to deploy my project on Docker so I deployed it on Repl which required me to have a index.html so that is what the project currently deploys to. 
I am sincerely sorry for my actions and understand you will grade it as it current sits. 

here is the link to my deployed https://in-fmidterm-hmhurt.replit.app/ project. 

I did deploy my database to Render! Which I think is working correctly! I struggled to use postman (due to internal sever errors, i think it had to do with my apache XXAMP)
to see my database so that actually might not work.
